        "description": "is a k-mer spectrum-based read error corrector, designed to correct large datasets with a very low memory footprint. It uses the disk streaming k-mer counting algorithm contained in the GATB library, and inserts solid k-mers in a bloom-filter. The correction procedure is similar to the Musket multistage approach.  Bloocoo yields similar results while requiring far less memory: as an example, it can correct whole \u2026",
