        "description": "an efficient de novo trascriptome assembler for RNA-Seq data. It can assemble transcripts from RNA-Seq reads (in fasta format). Unlike most of de novo assembly methods that build de Bruijn graph or splicing graph by connecting k-mers which are sets of overlapping substrings generated from reads, IsoTree constructs splicing graph by connecting reads directly. For each splicing graph, IsoTree applies an iterative scheme of \u2026",
