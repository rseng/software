        "description": "Using gravitational wave data, CCBH-Numerics computes the probability of the existence of a single cosmologically coupled black hole with a formation mass below a specified threshold. This tool was developed alongside the paper by Amendola, Rodrigues, Kumar, and Quartin, published in MNRAS in 2024",
