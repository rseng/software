        "description": "OpenCCM is a CFD-based compartment modelling software package. It is primarily intended for convection dominated reactive flows which feature a weak or one-way coupling between the reactive species and the carrier fluid, i.e. the reaction does not substantially influence the fluid flow over the course of the simulation.
