K-mer counting is important for many bioinformatics applications, e.g., developing de Bruijn graph assemblers. Building de Bruijn graphs is a commonly used approach for genome assembly with data from second-generation sequencer. Unfortunately, sequencing errors (frequent in practice) results in huge memory \u2026", "timestamp": "2022-07-18 17:45:32.378330"}}
