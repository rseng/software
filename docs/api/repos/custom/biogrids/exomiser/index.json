Starting from a VCF file and a set of phenotypes encoded using the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), it will annotate, filter and prioritize likely causative variants based on user-defined criteria such as a variant's predicted pathogenicity, frequency of occurrence in a population and also how closely the given phenotype matches \u2026", "timestamp": "2022-07-18 17:44:54.253033"}}
