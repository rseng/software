The most widely-used tools enable genome arithmetic. Bedtools allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF, VCF. While each individual tool is designed to do a relatively simple task (e.g., intersect two interval files), sophisticated analyses \u2026", "timestamp": "2022-07-18 17:43:31.206732"}}
