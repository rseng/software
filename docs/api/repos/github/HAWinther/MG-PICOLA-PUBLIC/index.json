It can compute matter power-spectra (CDM and total), redshift-space multipole power-spectra P0,P2,P4 and do halofinding on the fly. It can also include the effects of massive neutrinos on structure formation.", "created_at": "2017-03-02T12:09:46Z", "updated_at": "2022-11-23T02:03:05Z", "clone_url": "https://github.com/HAWinther/MG-PICOLA-PUBLIC.git", "size": 7636, "stargazers_count": 8, "watchers_count": 8, "language": "C", "license": {"key": "gpl-2.0", "name": "GNU General Public License v2.0", "spdx_id": "GPL-2.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/gpl-2.0", "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTg="}, "subscribers_count": 6, "owner": {"html_url": "https://github.com/HAWinther", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10915858?v=4", "login": "HAWinther", "type": "User"}, "topics": ["n-body", "n-body-simulator", "lcdm", "cola", "cosmology", "power-spectrum", "growth-factor"], "timestamp": "2023-07-02 00:53:48.779576", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10915858?v=4"}}
