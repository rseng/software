ATES solves the one-dimensional Euler, mass and energy conservation equations in radial coordinates through a finite-volume scheme. The hydrodynamics module is paired with a photoionization equilibrium solver that includes cooling via bremsstrahlung, recombination and collisional excitation/ionization for the case of an atmosphere of primordial composition (i.e., pure atomic hydrogen-helium), while also accounting for advection of the different ion species.", "created_at": "2021-01-20T14:02:56Z", "updated_at": "2022-03-29T18:30:27Z", "clone_url": "https://github.com/AndreaCaldiroli/ATES-Code.git", "size": 931, "stargazers_count": 9, "watchers_count": 9, "language": "Fortran", "owner": {"html_url": "https://github.com/AndreaCaldiroli", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77735945?v=4", "login": "AndreaCaldiroli", "type": "User"}, "timestamp": "2022-07-17 17:11:47.841692", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/77735945?v=4"}}
