K2CE was designed to work with standard Kepler or K2 data products: long-cadence (30 min) and short-cadence (1 min) light curve files and long-cadence and short-cadence target pixel files.  The tool has been modified to work with light curve files and target pixel files from the TESS mission.", "created_at": "2019-09-10T20:15:18Z", "updated_at": "2020-08-26T17:28:22Z", "clone_url": "https://github.com/nasa/K2CE.git", "size": 4613, "stargazers_count": 4, "watchers_count": 4, "language": "Python", "subscribers_count": 4, "owner": {"html_url": "https://github.com/nasa", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848102?v=4", "login": "nasa", "type": "Organization"}, "timestamp": "2022-07-17 17:15:15.127184", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/848102?v=4"}}
