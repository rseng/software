This routine accepts the image cubes (original image, model image, residual image) and generates several data products", "created_at": "2019-02-17T02:53:55Z", "updated_at": "2021-12-19T02:07:09Z", "clone_url": "https://github.com/AgentM-GEG/residual_feature_extraction.git", "size": 88018, "stargazers_count": 3, "watchers_count": 3, "language": "Python", "license": {"key": "mit", "name": "MIT License", "spdx_id": "MIT", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/mit", "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz"}, "subscribers_count": 1, "owner": {"html_url": "https://github.com/AgentM-GEG", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20112557?v=4", "login": "AgentM-GEG", "type": "User"}, "timestamp": "2022-07-17 16:49:19.736687", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/20112557?v=4"}}
