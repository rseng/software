The linking parameters, both transverse and along the line-of-sight, change as a function of redshift to account for selection effects.  The code is written in C++ and implements OMP to loop through the photometric redshift bins.", "created_at": "2014-03-20T10:53:04Z", "updated_at": "2022-04-25T15:35:36Z", "clone_url": "https://github.com/sfarrens/sfof.git", "size": 10730, "stargazers_count": 15, "watchers_count": 15, "language": "Python", "license": {"key": "mit", "name": "MIT License", "spdx_id": "MIT", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/mit", "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTEz"}, "subscribers_count": 5, "owner": {"html_url": "https://github.com/sfarrens", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6851839?v=4", "login": "sfarrens", "type": "User"}, "topics": ["redshift", "percolation", "galaxy", "clusters", "cosmology"], "timestamp": "2022-07-17 17:19:28.141377", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/6851839?v=4"}}
