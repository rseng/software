Given the results of a Bayesian model (possibly based on MCMC) in the form of simulations from the posterior distributions of suitable variables of costs and clinical benefits for two or more interventions, produces a health economic evaluation. Compares one of the interventions (the \"reference\") to the others (\"comparators\"). Produces many summary and plots to analyse the results", "created_at": "2020-05-14T15:15:34Z", "updated_at": "2022-01-04T13:13:37Z", "clone_url": "https://github.com/n8thangreen/BCEA.git", "homepage": "https://n8thangreen.github.io/BCEA/", "size": 114228, "language": "R", "open_issues_count": 47, "license": {"key": "gpl-3.0", "name": "GNU General Public License v3.0", "spdx_id": "GPL-3.0", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/gpl-3.0", "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTk="}, "subscribers_count": 1, "owner": {"html_url": "https://github.com/n8thangreen", "avatar_url": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3061918?v=4", "login": "n8thangreen", "type": "User"}, "topics": ["cost-effectiveness", "bayesian"], "timestamp": "2022-09-18 00:47:04.796498", "avatar": "https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/3061918?v=4"}}
